## 6. Architecture Overview

The `hydra-health-ai` application follows a full-stack architecture, separating the frontend and backend for improved scalability and maintainability.  The key components are:

*   **Frontend (React/Inertia.js):** Handles user interaction, data display, and communication with the backend API. Leverages TypeScript for type safety.
*   **Backend (Laravel):** Implements the business logic, manages data storage, handles API requests, and trains the AI model.
*   **Database (MySQL/MariaDB):** Stores user data, hydration logs, and AI model parameters.
*   **AI/ML Model:**  A trained model that generates personalized hydration recommendations based on user data, activity, and environmental factors.
*   **Real-time Updates:**  Uses Redis and Laravel Echo Server to push real-time updates to the frontend, such as new hydration data or notifications.
*   **Wearable Device Integration:** APIs for connecting to and synchronizing data from wearable devices (Apple HealthKit, Google Fit SDK).
*   **Voice Integration:** Uses a voice recognition API (Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or SiriKit) to process voice input for tracking water intake.

Detailed architecture, including foundational components, database schema, API design, frontend structure, real-time & event architecture, authentication flow, deployment plan, testing strategy, security hardening, and logging, is found in the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
